# image-segmentation-camvid
The project benchmarks U-Net, FPN, and PSPNet (each with DenseNet121 and ResNet101 encoders), plus a DenseASPP variant built on PSPNetâ€“DenseNet121, on a subset of the CamVid street-view dataset. Then MaskFormer architecture is fine-tuned and evaluated on an more complex version of the problem.
